	abstract = {Understanding the inﬂuences of forest management practices on wildﬁre severity is critical in ﬁre-prone ecosystems of the western United States. Newly available geospatial data sets characterizing vegetation, fuels, topography, and burn severity offer new opportunities for studying fuel treatment effectiveness at regional to national scales. In this study, we used ordinary least-squares ({OLS}) regression and sequential autoregression ({SAR}) to analyze fuel treatment effects on burn severity for three recent wildﬁres: the Camp 32 ﬁre in western Montana, the School ﬁre in southeastern Washington, and the Warm ﬁre in northern Arizona. Burn severity was measured using differenced normalized burn ratio ({dNBR}) maps developed by the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project. Geospatial data sets from the {LANDFIRE} project were used to control for preﬁre variability in canopy cover, fuels, and topography. Across all three ﬁres, treatments that incorporated prescribed burning were more effective than thinning alone. Treatment effect sizes were lower, and standard errors were higher in the {SAR} models than in the {OLS} models. Spatial error terms in the {SAR} models indirectly controlled for confounding variables not captured in the {LANDFIRE} data, including spatiotemporal variability in ﬁre weather and landscape-level effects of reduced ﬁre severity outside the treated areas. This research demonstrates the feasibility of carrying out assessments of fuel treatment effectiveness using geospatial data sets and highlights the potential for using spatial autoregression to control for unmeasured confounding factors.},

We compared the ability of 16 frequently-used factors to predict extinction risk for 45 vertebrate taxa. Median times to extinction were estimated using taxon-speciﬁc stochastic population models. Population size (N) and trend were clearly the best correlates of extinction risk in our data set. Stepwise multiple regression with additive and interaction terms identiﬁed N , N Â trend, plus taxonomic level, number of sub-populations Â N Â trend, number of oﬀspring (O) and N Â O as predictors, and explained 70\% of the variation. Trend was important in large, but not in small populations. Population size is the most important data to collect for threatened species and with trend should be the major focus in endangered species categorization and state of the environment reporting.},

	abstract = {Empirical knowledge of ecosystem stability and diversity-stability relationships is mostly based on the analysis of temporal variability of population and ecosystem properties. Variability, however, often depends on external factors that act as disturbances, making it difficult to compare its value across systems and relate it to other stability concepts. Here we show how variability, when viewed as a response to stochastic perturbations, can reveal inherent stability properties of ecological communities, with clear connections with other stability notions. This requires abandoning one-dimensional representations, in which a single variability measurement is taken as a proxy for how stable a system is, and instead consider the whole set of  variability values associated to a given community, reflecting the whole set of perturbations that can generate variability. Against the vertiginous dimensionality of the perturbation set, we show that a generic variability-abundance pattern emerges  from community assembly, which relates variability to the abundance of perturbed species. As a consequence, the response to stochastic immigration is governed by rare species while common species drive the response to environmental perturbations. In particular, the contrasting contributions of different species abundance classes can lead to opposite diversity-stability patterns, which can be understood from basic statistics of the abundance distribution. Our work shows that a multidimensional perspective on variability allows one to better appreciate the dynamical richness of ecological systems and the underlying meaning of their stability patterns.},

While the construction of such a global index is methodologically difﬁcult and arguable, it could be very useful to land planners when drawing up and reviewing forestry and environmental policies. The global index of forest sustainability suggested in this study is calculated for the ﬁfty Spanish provinces, based on a selection of twenty indicators. The majority of them (thirteen) relate to environmental dimension, four to economic dimension and three to social dimension. Numerous statistics and cartographic sources are used. A methodology is proposed based on grouping selected indicators according to three intermediate composite indicators and, subsequently, a global super-index. Cluster analysis establishes four different types of provinces according to their forest sustainability. According to the global sustainability index, part of the forests of the Mediterranean coast, those located near large inland cities and in southern Galicia appear to be less sustainable as a consequence of land artiﬁcialisation processes and forest ﬁres. Conversely, Atlantic and Pyrenees forests, and those of the northern Plateau are more sustainable due to their relative success in keeping forest traditional uses and containing emerging threats.},

Such changes, called regime shifts, can lead to degradation of ecological services. We study simple ecological models that show a catastrophic transition as a control parameter is varied and propose a novel early warning signal that exploits two ubiquitous features of ecological systems: nonlinearity and large external ﬂuctuations. Either reduced resilience or increased external ﬂuctuations can tip ecosystems to an alternative stable state. It is shown that changes in asymmetry in the distribution of time series data, quantiﬁed by changing skewness, is a model-independent and reliable early warning signal for both routes to regime shifts. Furthermore, using model simulations that mimic ﬁeld measurements and a simple analysis of real data from abrupt climate change in the Sahara, we study the feasibility of skewness calculations using data available from routine monitoring.},

	abstract = {Most work on generic early warning signals for critical transitions focuses on indicators of the phenomenon of critical slowing down that precedes a range of catastrophic bifurcation points. However, in highly stochastic environments, systems will tend to shift to alternative basins of attraction already far from such bifurcation points. In fact, strong perturbations (noise) may cause the system to “flicker” between the basins of attraction of the system’s alternative states. As a result, under such noisy conditions, critical slowing down is not relevant, and one would expect its related generic leading indicators to fail, signaling an impending transition. Here, we systematically explore how flickering may be detected and interpreted as a signal of an emerging alternative attractor. We show that—although the two mechanisms differ—flickering may often be reflected in rising variance, lag-1 autocorrelation and skewness in ways that resemble the effects of critical slowing down. In particular, we demonstrate how the probability distribution of a flickering system can be used to map potential alternative attractors and their resilience. Thus, while flickering systems differ in many ways from the classical image of critical transitions, changes in their dynamics may carry valuable information about upcoming major changes.},

Sudden eruption of invading populations from low to high abundance may be viewed as a regime shift from one alternative state to another. Previous research proposed several types of early warning signals to predict regime shifts in ecological systems such as polluted lakes and semiarid grasslands. This paper explores theoretically the potential of such indicators in predicting demographic regime shifts of invading populations. I analyzed a stochastic differential equation model for the population dynamics of an invasive species subject to Allee effects and propagule pressure. Diffusion approximation to the stochastic model suggests that persistent propagule pressure makes demographic regime shifts inevitable, but Allee effects can lengthen the mean time until regime shifts virtually indeﬁnitely. To compare the potential of indicators, I examined standard deviation, skewness, and estimated return rates of longitudinal population abundance. I found that standard deviation showed a distinct increase as regime shifts became more likely, but skewness and return rates showed no clear trends. This result suggests that standard deviation might be a useful warning signal for forecasting an impending demographic regime shift of invading populations during the period when their abundance is still low.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem dynamics can exhibit large, nonlinear changes after small changes in an environmental parameter that passes a critical threshold. These regime shifts are often associated with loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Because critical thresholds for regime shifts are hard to determine with precision, some recent studies have focused on deriving signals from dynamics leading up to the thresholds. Models in these studies depend on using noise terms independent of system parameters and variables to add stochasticity. However, demographic stochasticity, an important source of random variability, arises directly from system dynamics. In this study, a framework is developed for modeling demographic stochasticity in a mechanistic way, incorporating system variables and parameters. This framework is applied to a deterministic, dynamic model of a coral reef benthos. The resulting stochastic model indicates that increasing variance—but not skewness—is consistently found in system dynamics approaching a critical threshold of grazing pressure. Even if the threshold is breached, attraction of transient dynamics by a saddle point provides an opportunity for regime shift reversal by management intervention. These results suggest that early warning signals of regime shifts can arise intrinsically in endogenous dynamics and can be detected without reliance on random environmental forcings.},

	abstract = {Because novel ecological conditions can cause severe and long-lasting environmental damage with large economic costs, ecologists must identify possible environmental regime shifts and pro-actively guide ecosystem management. As an illustrative example, we applied six potential indicators of impending regime shifts to S. R. Carpenter and W. A. Brock’s model of lake eutrophication and analyzed whether or not they afforded adequate advance warning to enable preventative interventions. Our initial analyses suggest that an indicator based on the high-frequency signal in the spectral density of the time-series provides the best advance warning of a regime shift, even when only incomplete information about underlying system drivers and processes is available. In light of this result, we explored two key factors associated with using indicators to prevent regime shifts. The ﬁrst key factor is the amount of inertia in the system; i.e., how fast the system will react to a change in management, given that a manager can actually control relevant system drivers. If rapid, intensive management is possible, our analyses suggest that an indicator must provide at least 20 years advance warning to reduce the probability of a regime shift to ,5\%. As time to intervention is increased or intensity of intervention is decreased, the necessary amount of advance warning required to avoid a regime shift increases exponentially. The second key factor concerns the amount and type of variability intrinsic to the system, and the impact of this variability on the power of an indicator. Indicators are considered powerful if they detect an impending regime shift with adequate lead time for effective management intervention, but not so far in advance that interventions are too costly or unnecessary. Intrinsic ‘‘noise’’ in the system obscures the ‘‘signal’’ provided by all indicators, and therefore, the power of the indicators declines rapidly with increasing within- and between-year variability in measurable variables or parameters. Our results highlight the key role of human decisions in managing ecosystems and the importance of pro-active application of the precautionary principle to avoid regime shifts.},

	abstract = {Ecosystem dynamics can exhibit large, nonlinear changes after small changes in an environmental parameter that passes a critical threshold. These regime shifts are often associated with loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services. Because critical thresholds for regime shifts are hard to determine with precision, some recent studies have focused on deriving signals from dynamics leading up to the thresholds. Models in these studies depend on using noise terms independent of system parameters and variables to add stochasticity. However, demographic stochasticity, an important source of random variability, arises directly from system dynamics. In this study, a framework is developed for modeling demographic stochasticity in a mechanistic way, incorporating system variables and parameters. This framework is applied to a deterministic, dynamic model of a coral reef benthos. The resulting stochastic model indicates that increasing variance—but not skewness—is consistently found in system dynamics approaching a critical threshold of grazing pressure. Even if the threshold is breached, attraction of transient dynamics by a saddle point provides an opportunity for regime shift reversal by management intervention. These results suggest that early warning signals of regime shifts can arise intrinsically in endogenous dynamics and can be detected without reliance on random environmental forcings.},

Other complex biological systems show that increased variance and autocorrelations in time series may act as valid early warning signals for critical transitions. On population level, we determined the likelihood that increased variance and autocorrelation of hospital visit on cardiopulmonary disease preceded critical transitions in population health by human-pollution interactions. We investigated long-term hospital visits from a hospital in Nanjing City, China during 2006–2016 for the most important cardiopulmonary diseases likely to be inﬂuenced by air pollution: cerebrovascular accident disease ({CVAD}), coronary artery disease ({CAD}), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ({COPD}), lung cancer disease ({LCD}), and the grouped categories of respiratory system disease ({RESD}) and cardio-cerebrovascular system disease ({CCD}). The time series of standard deviations ({SDs}) and autocorrelation at-lag-1 ({AR}1) were studied as potential Early-Warning Indicators ({EWIs}) of transitions in population health. Elevated {SDs} provided an early warning for critical transitions in visit for {LCD} and overall {CCD} and {CVAD}, for the period of 2012–2013, after which a real transition of increased visit occurred for these disease categories. Statistical testing showed that these {SDs} were signiﬁcantly increased (p {\textless} 0.1). The long-term air pollution together with intermittent pollution episodes may have triggered critical transitions in population health for cardiopulmonary disease. It is recommended to consider signiﬁcant increases in variability in time series of relevant system parameters, such as visit, as early warning signs for future transitions in populations' health states.},

	abstract = {In this paper we examine the management of a natural resource, a ﬁshery, subject to regime shifting dynamics. A regime shift is deﬁned as an episode in which the dynamics of the resource can switch between two alternative regimes at random times. Speciﬁcally, we study the impact of reversible regime switching, both observed and unobserved, on optimal harvesting policy. The case in which the regime is not directly observed, i.e., observational uncertainty, is addressed by using the extended {POMDP} approach developed in Fackler and Paciﬁci (2014). We illustrate the performance of the model under different assumptions on the underlying stochastic growth variability, the biological structure of the stock in different regimes, and the resilience of the regimes. When the regime is known optimal policies depend on the population level and which regime is currently active. When the regime is unobserved, on the other hand, the optimal policy depends on the population level and a belief distribution about the current regime. In general when the probability of regime change is ﬁxed, and hence is not affected by harvesting policy, the optimal policy is of the constant-escapement variety. When the probability of switching regime is endogenous the optimal policy is no longer of the constant-escapement type. Optimal policies when the regime is uncertain are approximately equal to a weighted average of the policies when the regime is certain, with the weights equal to the beliefs in the associated regimes, but there are differences.},

	abstract = {The interplay between intrinsic population dynamics and environmental variation is still poorly understood. It is known, however, that even mild environmental noise may induce large ﬂuctuations in population abundances. This is due to a resonance effect that occurs in communities on the edge of stability. Here, we use a simple predator-prey model to explore the sensitivity of plankton communities to stochastic environmental ﬂuctuations. Our results show that the magnitude of resonance depends on the timescale of intrinsic population dynamics relative to the characteristic timescale of the environmental ﬂuctuations. Predator-prey communities with an intrinsic tendency to oscillate at a period T are particularly responsive to red noise characterized by a timescale of t p T/2p. We compare these theoretical predictions with the timescales of temperature ﬂuctuations measured in lakes and oceans. This reveals that plankton communities will be highly sensitive to natural temperature ﬂuctuations. More speciﬁcally, we demonstrate that the relatively fast temperature ﬂuctuations in shallow lakes fall largely within the range to which rotifers and cladocerans are most sensitive, while marine copepods and krill will tend to resonate more strongly with the slower temperature variability of the open ocean.},

Because of their important ecological and economic consequences, recent research has focused on devising early warning signals for anticipating such abrupt ecological transitions. In particular, theoretical studies show that changes in spatial characteristics of the system could provide early warnings of approaching transitions. However, the empirical validation of these indicators lag behind their theoretical developments. Here, we summarize a range of currently available spatial early warning signals, suggest potential null models to interpret their trends, and apply them to three simulated spatial data sets of systems undergoing an abrupt transition. In addition to providing a step-by-step methodology for applying these signals to spatial data sets, we propose a statistical toolbox that may be used to help detect approaching transitions in a wide range of spatial data. We hope that our methodology together with the computer codes will stimulate the application and testing of spatial early warning signals on real spatial data.},

	abstract = {Slower recovery from perturbations near a tipping point and its indirect signatures in fluctuation patterns have been suggested to foreshadow catastrophes in a wide variety of systems1,2. Recent studies of populations in the field and in the laboratory have used time-series data to confirm some of the theoretically predicted early warning indicators, such as an increase in recovery time or in the size and timescale of fluctuations3–6. However, the predictive power of temporal warning signals is limited by the demand for long-term observations. Large-scale spatial data are more accessible, but the performance of warning signals in spatially extended systems7–10 needs to be examined empirically3,11–13. Here we use spatially extended yeast populations, an experimental system displaying a fold bifurcation6, to evaluate early warning signals based on spatio-temporal fluctuations and to identify a novel warning indicator in space. We found that two leading indicators based on fluctuations increased before collapse of connected populations; however, the magnitude of increase was smaller than that observed in isolated populations, possibly because local variation is reduced by dispersal. Furthermore, we propose a generic indicator based on deterministic spatial patterns, “recovery length”. As the spatial counterpart of recovery time14, recovery length is defined as the distance for connected populations to recover from perturbations in space (e.g. a region of poor quality). In our experiments, recovery length increased substantially before population collapse, suggesting that the spatial scale of recovery can provide a superior warning signal before tipping points in spatially extended systems.},
